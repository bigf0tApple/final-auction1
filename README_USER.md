# ARPO Studio - How It Works

Welcome to ARPO Studio! This guide explains everything you need to know about bidding on NFT auctions.

---

## 🎨 What is ARPO Studio?

ARPO Studio is an **on-chain NFT auction house**. Artists mint their digital artworks as NFTs, and collectors bid to own them. Everything happens on the blockchain - transparent, secure, and permanent.

## ⏰ Anti-Sniping Protection

**What is sniping?** Placing a bid in the final second so no one can respond.

**Our solution:** If someone bids in the **last 10 seconds**, the auction extends by **10 more seconds**.

```
Example:
- Auction ends at 3:00:00 PM
- Bid placed at 2:59:55 PM (5 seconds left)
- Auction NOW ends at 3:00:05 PM
- Another bid at 3:00:03 PM → extends to 3:00:13 PM
- ...continues until 10 seconds pass with no bids
```

This gives everyone a fair chance to respond!

## ❓ FAQ

### Is this real money?

**Right now, NO.** We're on testnet using free test ETH. When we launch on mainnet, real ETH will be used.

### What if I win but can't pay?

You already paid! Bids are on-chain. If you bid 1 ETH, that 1 ETH was sent when you clicked bid.

### Can I cancel my bid?

**No.** All bids are final. Think before you bid!

### What if the site goes down?

Your NFT is safe on the blockchain. You can access it from any NFT marketplace that supports Base.

### Do I own the copyright?

You own the NFT (the digital certificate). Copyright depends on what the artist specifies.

### How do I sell my NFT?

Once you win, the NFT is in your wallet. You can:
- List it on OpenSea
- Sell it on any NFT marketplace
- Transfer it to anyone

## 🛡️ Safety Tips

1. **Never share your private key**
2. **Double-check wallet addresses**
3. **Only bid what you can afford**
4. **Verify you're on the real site**
